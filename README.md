Lock Game is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board, comprising 64 squares. Each player possesses 8 pieces, and the primary objective is to diminish the opponent's piece count to less than 2.

In the initial phase of the game, players position their stones on the squares in the nearest row to them. Subsequently, players take turns maneuvering one of their stones in an attempt to obstruct the movement of their opponent's stones. Stones are allowed to be moved either horizontally or vertically to any desired distance within the game area; however, jumping over stones is not permitted.

A stone is considered locked if it has an opponent's stone in its two adjacent squares horizontally, vertically, or in the corner with opponent's stones in both adjacent squares horizontally and vertically. The player, on their turn, removes one or more of the opponent's stones from the board if they successfully lock them with their move. In other words, a player, during their turn, removes the opponent's stone or stones that they have locked using the movement of their own stone. The player who successfully reduces the opponent's stone count to less than 2 wins the game.
